	<h1>Events</h1>
	<p>In addition to the wedding, we are planning a few other addition events.</p>

	<section>
		<h1>Pre-Party</h1>

		<p>On the day before the wedding, Friday, 20 March, we are planning to have a fun and casual
		   pre-party.  This is yet to be confirmed, but there will be good food and (hopefully)
		   a jumping castle (or other fun activity).  More details will be provided as this is confirmed.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Wedding Ceremony</h1>

		<p>The wedding ceremony will be in the early afternoon on Saturday, 21 March. (Exact time and
		location to be set).</p>

		<p><em>Note: Please ensure you have suitable footwear for sandy beach conditions.</em></p>

	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Reception</h1>

		<p>The reception will immediately follow the ceremony, to be held at <a href="">Sublime Point</a>.
		   For those of you without a car, we will assist with arranging transport from the beach
		   ceremony to the reception.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Sunday Brunch</h1>

		<p>Primarily for the benefit of our close friends travelling from overseas, we are planning
		   to have a relaxing, post-wedding brunch on Sunday morning.</p>
