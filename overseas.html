	<h1>Overseas Visitors</h1>

	<section>
		<h1>Visitor Visas</h1>
		<p>Those of you who are travelling to Australia from overseas need to ensure you have a valid
		   visa to enter Australia.  Information about the available visitor visas may be obtained from
		   the <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/Visit/Pages/Visit.aspx">Australian Department of
		   Immigration and Border Protection</a>.</p>

		<p>Norwegians, Romanians and many other Europeans are eligible to apply online for an
		   <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/Visas/Pages/651.aspx">eVisitor (subclass 651)</a>.
		   Other nationalities should consult
		   <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/Visas/Pages/651.aspx?tab=1&amp;heading=who-could-get-this-visa">the list of eligible countries.</a></p>

		<p>If you are not eligible for the eVisitor, you should check your eligibility for the
		   Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601) or Visitor visa (subclass 600). These visas incur
		   application processing fees.</p>

		<h1>Flights</h1>

		<p>The flight from Oslo to Sydney generally takes between 24 and 30 hours,
		   depending on the exact route and layover times, and generally cost between
		   8,000 and 10,000 NOK (if you book early).</p>

		<p>As there are many of you travelling from Norway, you may like to arrange to travel together
		   with some friends who are also attending.  Please arrange this amongst yourselves. We can
		   let you know who else will be going.</p>

		<h1>Arrival in Australia</h1>

		<h2>Border Control</h2>

		<p>Please note that Australia has
		   <a href="http://www.customs.gov.au/individuals/goingthroughtheborder/default.asp">strict border control procedures</a>
		   in place. Among other things, you must declare any food that you have with you. Unlike
		   many European destinations, there is no "nothing to declare" line that you may simply walk
		   straight through, no questions asked.  If in doubt, be honest and declare everything.</p>

		<h2>Travelling from the Airport</h2>

		<p>The easiest way to travel from the airport to your final destination is to take the train.
		   See the <a href="http://www.sydneytrains.info/stations/network_map">City Rail network map</a>.</p>

		<p>For those of you travelling directly to Wollongong (or nearby suburbs), near where our
		   wedding is located, you will need to take an Airport Line train (green line) either
		   northbound to Central or southbound to Wolli Creek and then change to the Illawarra and
		   South Coast line (blue line) heading south to Wollongong.  Check the time table, as not
		   all South Coast line trains stop at Wolli Creek, so it may be faster to go via Central.
		   This journey takes approximately 90 minutes.</p>
